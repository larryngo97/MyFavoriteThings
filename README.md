## Overview

The application starts up with the title of the app and a button. The button "new" will allow the user to create a new event with a customizable title, image from their gallery,
and a description. When they are satisfied with their event, they can click the "save" button to save it and it will reappear in the main screen, where the title is now
ommitted. They can either add another event or click on their event to view it. They may close the application and go back to it to see that their events have been saved
due to storing in a SQLite database.
